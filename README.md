# Jamulus Traffic Analyzer

This is a peice of software that takes the ouput of the jamulus traffic data file and does some analytical analysis of traffic, and shows
some general statistics over a specified date range. Not quite finished yet. Currently it identifies unique users and jam sessions and totals them up,
but there are bugs in getting correct time totals. 

## TODO:
Fix time bug, hours are not calculating corrently when jam times go past midnight

General Refactor to ease readability

Export analysis data as CSV
